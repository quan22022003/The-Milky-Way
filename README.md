# The_Milky_Way
A text-based adventure game in Scala.

This project is a text adventure game where players can explore various worlds and embark on different adventures. The game provides a range of settings and challenges for players to engage with, allowing them to choose their own path and interact with the game world.

## Game Concepts

The game offers several adventure concepts that players can choose from, including:

- **Classic Adventure**: Explore an ancient pyramid or venture into a ruined castle. Navigate through rooms, passages, and solve puzzles.

- **Modern Adventure**: Play as a first-year student at university and accomplish specific tasks within campus buildings and rooms.

- **Mystery Adventure**: Recover a lost item, solve a crime, or unravel a mysterious story through investigation and exploration.

- **Action Adventure**: Find a way to escape from a dangerous situation, such as a locked room or a treacherous environment.

- **Literary Adventure**: Take on the role of famous literary characters like Alice, Captain Ahab, Clarice Starling, or others, and embark on their unique journeys.

- **Inhuman Adventure**: Experience the world from the perspective of a dog, insect, robot, or any other non-human entity, encountering challenges and completing objectives.

- **Something Completely Different**: Create a game that goes beyond traditional spatial locations and explores abstract concepts like states of mind or stages of life.

Players can immerse themselves in these different adventures, each offering its own challenges and opportunities.

## Gameplay

- **Areas**: Players can enter various areas within the game world, each with its own unique features and challenges.
